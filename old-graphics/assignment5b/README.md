Chalktalk Feature Idea
======================

This is an idea extension for JS-based research and learning tool, Chalktalk, which has not yet been released. My idea is to implement "Survival Mode" where characters have AI perception of safety versus danger. This could help illustrate a variety of lectures and talks on bullying, natural disasters, mental disorders, fight vs. flight, perception, social communities and behavior, and more.

This presentation itself is simply an edited fork of the Reveal.js framework.
